Utility WP plugin to allow users with Contributor role to upload images

== Description ==

Utility WP plugin to allow users with Contributor role to upload images.

By default WordPress does not grant the "upload_files" capability to the
Contributor role. This plugin adds the "upload_files" capability to
the Contributor role when it is activated.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `go-allow-contributors-to-upload-images` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate `Gigaom Contributor Upload Permission Fixer` through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress

== Contributing ==

This plugin is developed and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/GigaOM/go-allow-contributors-to-upload-images/). Contributions and questions are welcome!
