# Gigaom Contributor Upload Permission Fixer
A tiny plugin that allows Contributors to upload images when activated

## Description
By default WordPress does not grant the "upload_files" capability to the
Contributor role. This plugin adds the "upload_files" capability to
the Contributor role when it is activated.
